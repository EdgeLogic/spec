EdgeLogic
===================
Edgelogic is in the process of setting up a Github project for the development of an open source software solution to the micro payments problem within the Bitcoin protocol. ~ Basically Bitcoin is quite an effective solution for large transactions, but because of the transaction fees miners charge, micro payments do not work very well.

Micro Payments Type 1 and Type 2
===================
**Micro Payments type 1** ~ Some work has been done in the the Micro payments branch of BitcoinJ, by Mike Hearn et al, but the type of micro payments conceived here were from client to server, i.e. for web users to pay micro payments to a pay-wall or similar. We see this as the first generation of alt currency micro payments systems, but it does not address some important possible use-cases. We call this Micro Payments type 1.

**Micro Payments type 2** ~ would be payments going from Server to Client, in other words from businesses to end users for services provided by those end-users. (For example the ‘collective computing‘ aspects of the SETI@home project, or Edgelogic’s proposed Bittunes network)  or This important area has been overlooked until now. We believe this is a very important and worthy development, and as such should be worked on by a large group of developers under an appropriate open license structure, so we have chosen the MIT License framework to develop this project under.
