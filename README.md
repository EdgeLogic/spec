D-Net is a new kind of ‘connectivity protocol’ that would enable devices to collectively form cooperative networks without any central control.
The technology creates ‘intelligent heuristic networks’, with advanced control features applied to networks, rather than nodes (or servers). The D-Net  protocol will be open source and available to third parties for customized network applications, and would provide the foundation of infinitely scalable Internet consumer-market applications.
